This repository shows my contribution to the Bewander website. Specifically - I was tasked with the flag modal and ensuring its functionality in relation with the flag data table.

When I took over, the flag modal was present but it looked very bland and wasn't communicating with the flag data table properly. Whenever a user would try to flag something, it wouldn't create the flag at all for the admin to view. The flag modal was also built originally as a radio button selection, which was an eyesore to the end user.

I completed the flag modal that now comes complete with a drop down list for the user to choose from for flag options. It also communicates with the flag data table so that an admin can see which user, which post, what type of flag the user chose and what date and time the user flagged the post. This ensures that the admin can easily find the post that has been flagged for review and take necessary action. They can also inform the user who flagged the post as to which action has been taken to rectify said flag, and also inform the original poster that their post has been flagged and what action has been taken.
